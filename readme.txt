Team: Hacklings
Project: Water Hacklings
Location: Sydney (remote youth team)

What did we make? 
We made a model of a playground we think the council should build hopefully you think that too. It isnâ€™t just an ordinary playground it is a fun place teaching children about water. It teachers children how we get water to our houses, and things that affect this process positively and negatively. This playground is free and accessible to everyone. It is great for school excursions.
